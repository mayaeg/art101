			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to show that we understand how to make lists, link to other pages, insert images, etc.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too many issues with this assignment, I just had to refer back to the lecture slides for reference on the details of what exactly to write. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like this assignment went pretty well for me.  I hadn't written code much yet because I have been more guiding my partner so I got to relearn some things for this class as I completed this assignment.  I think I put a good amount of energy into this lab because I really wanted to learn how to do it right. </p>
